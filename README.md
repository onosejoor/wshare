# WShare: Effortless File Sharing üöÄ

WShare is a robust and intuitive platform designed for seamless file sharing. Built with a powerful Go backend for rapid file processing and a dynamic Next.js frontend for a smooth user experience, WShare offers secure uploads, generates shareable links, and provides efficient file management. Say goodbye to cumbersome transfers and hello to effortless sharing! ‚ú®

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To get WShare up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### üì• Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onosejoor/wshare.git
cd wshare
```

### üîê Environment Variables

WShare requires a few environment variables for its backend to function correctly. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and populate it with your Backblaze B2 credentials and the desired origin for cron jobs:

```
# server/.env
B2_APPKEY="your_backblaze_application_key"
B2_KEYID="your_backblaze_key_id"
PORT="8080" # Or any port you prefer
ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000" # Set to your frontend URL
```

### üöÄ Backend Setup (Go)

Navigate to the `server` directory, download dependencies, and build the application:

```bash
cd server
go mod download
go build -o main ./main.go
./main
```

The Go server should now be running on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is `8080`).

### üì¶ Frontend Setup (Next.js)

Open a new terminal, navigate to the `client` directory, install the necessary dependencies, and start the development server:

```bash
cd client
npm install # Or use yarn install / pnpm install
npm run dev
```

The Next.js frontend will typically start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üíª Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can start using WShare:

1.  **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
2.  **Upload Files**:
    *   You'll see a prominent drag-and-drop area on the homepage.
    *   Drag one or more files into this area, or click the "browse" link to select files from your system.
    *   WShare supports uploading single files or multiple files (which will be automatically archived into a ZIP file on the server).
    *   There's a 100MB per-file limit, and a 100MB total size limit for multiple files.
3.  **Monitor Upload Progress**: After selecting files, click the "Upload" button. You'll see a progress bar indicating the upload status.
4.  **Get Shareable Links**: Upon successful upload, a unique shareable URL will be generated and displayed. Click the copy icon next to the URL to save it to your clipboard.
5.  **Download Files**: Share the generated URL with anyone. When accessed, the page will display the file name and a download button. Clicking the "Download File" button will initiate the download.
6.  **View Recent Uploads**: Scroll down the homepage to see your "Recent Uploads". This section displays files you've recently uploaded from your current browser session.
7.  **Delete Uploaded Files**: From the "Recent Uploads" section, you can click the trash icon next to a file to delete it from storage, along with its entry in your history.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Instant File Sharing**: Effortlessly upload and share files with anyone via unique, direct links.
*   **Secure Cloud Storage**: Files are securely stored using Backblaze B2, ensuring reliability and data integrity.
