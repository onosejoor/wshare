### Uploading Files

1.  Send a `POST` request to `/file` with the file included in the `multipart/form-data`.
2.  Ensure that the form field name is `file`.

```bash
curl -X POST -F 'file=@/path/to/your/file.txt' http://localhost:8080/file
```

### Example Code

Here's an example of how to upload files using JavaScript:

```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
formData.append('file', fileInput.files[0]);

fetch('http://localhost:8080/file', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    console.log(data);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

To access the uploaded files, you'll receive a signed URL after a successful upload, which you can use to directly access the file from Backblaze B2.
